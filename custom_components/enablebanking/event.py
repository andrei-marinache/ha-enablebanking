"""Event platform: one transaction feed per account.

A transaction is not a state, so it does not belong in a sensor. Home
Assistant's `event` entity is the domain built for "this happened", and it is
what Home Assistant core's own bank integration uses — see
`homeassistant/components/monzo/event.py`.

The difference is the trigger. Monzo receives webhooks and fires one event per
push; Enable Banking is poll-only under the PSD2 four-polls-a-day cap, so
events arrive in batches whenever a poll discovers entries it has not seen
before. The automation interface is identical, the timing is coarser, and the
README says so rather than leaving people to wonder why their notification is
three hours late.
