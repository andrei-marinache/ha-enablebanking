    trigger. The cache round-trip (disk to coordinator) relies on these
    fields being persisted alongside the balance itself so that, after an
    HA restart, the sensor can show exactly how old the displayed value
    is and whether a back-off is still in force.

    ``stable_id`` is Enable Banking's ``identification_hash``, an
    account-intrinsic value (derived from IBAN+currency, or resource_id for
    IBAN-less accounts) that stays constant across sessions. It is the key we
    use for entity identity and the cache. ``account_id`` is the session-scoped
    ``uid`` which Enable Banking regenerates on every reauth; it is only used
    to call ``GET /accounts/{uid}/balances`` and to migrate old entity ids.
