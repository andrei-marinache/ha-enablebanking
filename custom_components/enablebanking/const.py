DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL: Final = 8 * 60 * 60

# Sensor staleness threshold as originally designed: flag `stale: true` if the
# last successful poll is more than this many hours old, which allows for the
# 12-hour overnight gap plus slack. Currently NOT wired up: sensor._is_stale
# compares against 2x DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL (16 h) instead. Kept so the intended

MAX_REMEMBERED_TRANSACTIONS: Final = 2000
